0	PRMT5  a type II protein @chemical$ methyltransferase  is upregulated in numerous cancers  including TNBC  and plays a critical role  marked it as an attractive therapeutic target.	arginine	type II protein arginine methyltransferase
1	@gene$  a type II protein @chemical$ methyltransferase  is upregulated in numerous cancers  including TNBC  and plays a critical role  marked it as an attractive therapeutic target.	arginine	PRMT5
2	RESULTS: Through the design  synthesis and screening of a series of targeted compounds  we identified @chemical$ as an effective compound that exerted cytotoxic effects and reduced the protein levels of PRMT5 and its key downstream target protein @gene$ in TNBC after 48 h. Its efficacy was significantly superior to the PRMT5 PROTAC degraders that had been reported.	YZ 836P	KLF5
3	RESULTS: Through the design  synthesis and screening of a series of targeted compounds  we identified @chemical$ as an effective compound that exerted cytotoxic effects and reduced the protein levels of @gene$ and its key downstream target protein @gene$ in TNBC after 48 h. Its efficacy was significantly superior to the PRMT5 PROTAC degraders that had been reported.	YZ 836P	PRMT5
4	Additionally  we demonstrated that @chemical$ promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of PRMT5 in a cereblon  @gene$  dependent manner.	YZ 836P	CRBN
5	Additionally  we demonstrated that @chemical$ promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of @gene$ in a cereblon  @gene$  dependent manner.	YZ 836P	PRMT5
6	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation of total antioxidant capacity  T AOC   @chemical$ peroxidase  GSH PX   and advanced oxidized protein product  AOPP  levels in the progression of oral mucositis  OM  during nasopharyngeal carcinoma  NPC  radiotherapy.	glutathione	glutathione peroxidase
7	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation of total antioxidant capacity  T AOC   @chemical$ peroxidase  @gene$   and advanced oxidized protein product  AOPP  levels in the progression of oral mucositis  OM  during nasopharyngeal carcinoma  NPC  radiotherapy.	glutathione	GSH PX
8	T AOC  @chemical$ PX  and AOPP were measured before treatment  T0  and during the second week  T1   fourth week  T2   and sixth week  T3  of the intensity modulated radiation therapy  IMRT  period.	GSH	GSH PX
9	Serum T AOC  @chemical$ PX  and AOPP levels were compared at different time periods.	GSH	GSH PX
10	RESULTS: At T1 and T2 of IMRT  T AOC and @chemical$ PX were higher in the SOM group than in the Non SOM group  At T3  T AOC and @gene$ were lower in the SOM group than in the Non SOM group.	GSH	GSH PX
11	T AOC and @chemical$ PX had similar change trends in Non SOM or SOM patients  i.e.  T AOC levels continued to increase at T2 and decreased at T3  and @gene$ increased significantly at T2 and decreased at T3.	GSH	GSH PX
12	Of interest was the fact that T AOC and @chemical$ PX decreased significantly more in SOM patients than in Non SOM patients at T3  and that AOPP levels were in a constant state of increase in SOM patients.	GSH	GSH PX
13	CONCLUSIONS: NPC patients undergoing IMRT exhibit dynamic alterations in blood T AOC  @chemical$ PX  and AOPP.	GSH	GSH PX
